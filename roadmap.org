*** TODO Notebook add
*** TODO Notebook del
*** TODO Display NodeGroups
    Need to create more visual intuition around node groups. Right now there is no visual relationship between a node and its siblings(node group). Should eliminate the space between sibling nodes and increase the size of selected node.

* Bugs
** DONE Smaller screen sizes have scroll bars
   CLOSED: [2017-02-21 Tue 10:33]

** DONE Pane focus issues 
   CLOSED: [2017-02-28 Tue 11:17]
   When a pane becomes focused (like, input focused) and it is off screen at all the browser automatically scrolls it on screen. This wouldn't be a problem but it overrides the custom scrolling that I do. Will probably need to eliminate the tabindex and focus thing I have going on and move key event handlers to the app root :(

** TODO Editor isn't "dirty" until several character difference
** DONE Don't toggle editor when link is clicked
