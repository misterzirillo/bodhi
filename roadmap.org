* Bugs
** TODO Some odd scrolling when moving a node
** TODO Handle case of no roots for user
** TODO Editor isn't "dirty" until several character difference
** TODO Keyboard doesn't work in firefox
   Do I even care about firefox?
** DONE Smaller screen sizes have scroll bars
   CLOSED: [2017-02-21 Tue 10:33]
** DONE Pane focus issues 
   CLOSED: [2017-02-28 Tue 11:17]
   When a pane becomes focused (like, input focused) and it is off screen at all the browser automatically scrolls it on screen. This wouldn't be a problem but it overrides the custom scrolling that I do. Will probably need to eliminate the tabindex and focus thing I have going on and move key event handlers to the app root :(
