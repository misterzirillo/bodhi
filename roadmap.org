    # Welcome to Bodhi
    The most premier-est note taking app. The most efficient way to control Bodhi is with the keyboard (clicking is allowed too).

    The up and down arrow keys navigate between this note and its siblings. The left and right arrow keys move between a note and it's children/parent. Move to this note's child with the right arrow key.

    ## Controls

    - **Ctrl+Shift+Down:** Create a sibling below the currently selected node.
