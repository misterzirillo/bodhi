# Welcome to Bodhi
Bodhi is a handy document organization tool. The purpose of Bodhi is to separate an otherwise linear document into manageable bits.

The smallest unit of a Bodhi document is the _leaf_. Each leaf may have a parent, sibling, and child leaves. Related leaves will change color and align as you navigate the _tree_. When the leaves are put together they form the document.

## Controlling Bodhi
The most efficient way to control Bodhi is with the keyboard (clicking is allowed too). Take a moment to acquaint yourself with the keyboard controls shown in the next leaf.
